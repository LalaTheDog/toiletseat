Design files for a Toilet Seat for Lala for the Kohler Reve for when she gets too old to balance

Lala is getting old and may not be able to balance on the rim for much longer.  These files are for a 3d printed insert to increase the surface area that she can stand on. All four of my toilets are the Kohler Reve, which is square and does not accept standard toiletseats.

Lala primarily balances on the front rim, so that is the area which I intended to make larger.

A piece of clear film was placed over the toilet and it was traced with a marker.

I then replicated the outline in illustrator, and used a cricut to cut the shape from cardstock.  I checked the shape against the toilet, and then made modifications to get as close as I could to the shape. The hole is slightly egg shaped, and the walls tilt inwards at diferent angles.  They are more steep near the corners.

I then used the vector file to extrude the 3d model out in fusion 360 and generally model the object as desired.

It was cut into 4 to facilitate printing on printers will smaller print beds.

I used a phone scanner to scan the toilet into a mesh model which is pretty rough, and looked to see if it matched my model.

The seat was printed in polycarbonate.
