Design files for a Toilet Seat for Lala for the Kohler Reve for when she gets too old to balance

Lala is getting old and may not be able to balance on the rim for much longer.  These files are for a 3d printed insert to increase the surface area that she can stand on. All four of my toilets are the Kohler Reve, which is square and does not accept standard toiletseats.

Lala primarily balances on the front rim, so that is the area which I intended to make larger.

A piece of clear film was placed over the toilet and it was traced with a marker.

I then replicated the outline in illustrator, and used a cricut to cut the shape from cardstock.  I checked the shape against the toilet, and then made modifications to get as close as I could to the shape. The hole is slightly egg shaped, and the walls tilt inwards at diferent angles.  They are more steep near the corners.

I then used the vector file to extrude the 3d model out in fusion 360 and generally model the object as desired.

It was cut into 4 to facilitate printing on printers will smaller print beds.

I used a phone scanner to scan the toilet into a mesh model which is pretty rough, and looked to see if it matched my model.

The seat was printed in polycarbonate.

Some dimension gaps were noted. 6mm width and 2.5mm height.

It was coated in Gorilla clear spray, and the top was coated with the white plasti dip
It was pretty smooth so it was painted with the black plasti dip with a brush, two coats, then sand was sprinkled all over it
It was then sprayed again with the white plastidip before it really got a chance to dry

Lala was confused by the seat, probably smells strongly of the paint, and it also feels weird and changes how her feet can be positioned. She usually leaves one pad hanging on the inside edge, probably to know where the ledge is. Pretending to go into her crate with food was enough to light a fire under her butt to get her to do what I asked instead of just standing there and alternate looking at the toilet and me.

Typically if she's disinterested in something, if I act like I want it, suddenly she wants it 100x more. The moment I don't want it anymore, she doesn't either. I guess dogs are not all that different than humans.

A new model was made, with ridges and a differently shaped hole.  The geometry of the center flange was also slightly adjusted.

It was printed in PETG this time.

The gaps were filled with waterproof epoxy putty and the entire model was sprayed with the gorilla clear spray. The bottom was then coated in the black plasti dip.  The top was then coated with clear paint on flex seal and sprinkled with fine sand.  As of 12 hours later, it's still tacky, so cure time might be much longer than the plasti dip.

It may take a few days before it's cured enough to coat with the white plasti dip spray.

The plasti dip peels freely from the cured flex seal paint on. This could be a feature, or a problem. For now I think it's more of a problem. I think the gorilla + plasti dip paint on + sand + plasti dip spray is a better combo. It also cures faster, but I can't remove the flex seal reasonably, so maybe for next time.

I find the cured flex seal to feel slippery, which is the opposite of what I want, so besides waterproofing it provides no benefit, since all the others also waterproof. It also cures really slow. Unless you want a surface that plasti-dip can peel from for easy replacement, I don't think it's useful.
